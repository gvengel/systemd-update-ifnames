About
=====

This script will predict the interface names generated by systemd,
before the system has booted and assigned names, and update the network
interfaces configs with the new name. i.e. After a release upgrade, so
you can reboot the system without losing network access.

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 upgrades.

Usage
=====

The script should be run after do-release-upgrade, but before you reboot.

    ./systemd-update-ifnames
